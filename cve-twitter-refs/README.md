I'm worried that Twitter's impending collapse is going to nuke a lot of CVE
references. Let's fix that.

## Collecting CVEs with Twitter references

First, let's get the list of CVEs that have Twitter references. That's easy
and fun on the NVD's website:

`curl --location "https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?keywordSearch=twitter.com%2F" > cves.json`

Format that thing with `jq` so I can actually read it:

`jq -M < cves.json > cves-jq.json && mv cves-jq.json cves.json`

Get the list of Twitter references:

`cat cves.json| jq '.vulnerabilities[].cve.references[] | select(.url|test("http.*twitter.com/")).url'`

Hmm, seems like a lot, and also there are just some usernames in there, no posts. How about:

`cve-twitter-refs % cat cves.json| jq '.vulnerabilities[].cve.references[] | select(.url|test("http.*twitter.com/.*/status")).url' > urls.txt`

Better, but mine eyes see dupes. So:

```bash
cat cves.json| jq '.vulnerabilities[].cve.references[] | select(.url|test("http.*twitter.com/.*/status")).url' > \
sort | uniq > urls.txt
```

377 references total. That's quite tractable. Oh, look at that:

That's a poignant Tweet we'll definitely want to save.

## Ensuring these references are saved off

So now we can admire all these tweets that are Real and Official References to CVEs, but what I really want to do is to make sure they're accessible for future generations of software archeologists. Surely, there's some way to do this... yes! [Archive Now](https://github.com/oduwsdl/archivenow) to the rescue!

So let's follow their docs and get that set up.

(time passes, turns out I've not installed Xcode, Python3, any of that nerd stuff on this laptop yet...)

(Take this time to install a spellchecker for VSCode...)
