# Disputed and Rejected CVEs

This is just a quick check to see what's up with badly-behaving CVE-2025 entries.

```
    114 disputed-today.txt
      17 rejected-after-disputed.txt
      79 rejected-after-published.txt
     808 rejected-unpublished.txt
     904 rejected.txt
```

Turns out, about 8/9ths of rejected CVEs in the CVE-2025 set started life rejected. So sad.

There are 114 disputed CVEs today, and of the 79 CVEs that were rejected after they were published, only 17 went through a dispute phase.
