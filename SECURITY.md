# Security Policy

Wow, you probably shouldn't rely on this stuff for anything that has a security
concern. It's called a junkdrawer, after all.

## Supported Versions

No version of anything in here is supported in any normal sense.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

That said, if you notice a security vulnerability in here, I'm certainly interested
in hearing about it! Just drop me a line: todb@packetfu.com and tell me your tale.

In order to cut down on the back-and-forth please be explicit about:

* The precise path to the vulnerable software.
* A [CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/) description of a good guess of the type of vuln.
* Any notes you might have about what an attacker can actually accomplish by exploiting it.
* A pointer to where this is being used in production so I can get whoever did that to reconsider.
